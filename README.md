Hello There
=========

In this repo I implement the code from http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com, in particular, I have addtionally vectorised the code to perform mimibatch stochastic gradient descent (the tutorial uses a for loop over the examples). It's been my first self-thaugth exposure to deep learning.

I have now implemented also a full python / numpy modular deep learning library, you can check it at https://github.com/UfoRobot/PyDeep
